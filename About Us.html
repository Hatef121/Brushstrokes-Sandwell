                            Brushstrokes is a partnership community project set up in 1999 by Sister Margaret and the Father Hudson’s Society.
                            
                             <br/>
                            
                            Bush Avenue was the first home of the Brushstrokes Project and volunteers went out to find those most hidden and neglected. Soon Brushstrokes was hosting Family Activities, ESOL and  IT classes at the house. The attic stored Christmas gifts and book shelves in a tiny front room became a food store and the Parish Centre for clothing.

                            Brushstrokes Community Project was officially opened by Archbishop Vincent Nicholls in the Parish Centre of St Philip of Neri.  However, two months later the Centre was destroyed in an arson attack. It was a devastating blow but somehow Brushstrokes carried on. ​ A few months later Brushstrokes was back into a much improved building. Since then the Project has gone from strength to strength.

Enabled by the support of the project’s newest partner, The Sisters of our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, Brushstrokes moved to a new building. Located right at the heart of the community, it will allow Brushstrokes to increase the support it offers to the community.
