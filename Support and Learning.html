                    Brushstrokes is an accredited ESB centre. Learners can work towards ESB exams but these are not compulsory.  Classes run from Monday to Friday throughout Sandwell term time. Classes take place at our main office and Smethwick library.

            <div class="Activity-description">The ability to speak and understand English is the most important component in enabling individuals to be able to build strong relationships in the local community. Our community based ESOL continues to help individuals in their process of integration, as Alexandra one of our students says , “I can talk to my neighbours and now I can talk to new people in the park when I take my children.” to be Updated w/c 19th April. 

                ​<br/>
                
                 It is so rewarding to see learners grow in confidence as their language skills improve and they develop the ability to communicate in English on a daily basis.  A huge part of ESOL classes is the social aspect and many friendships are made in the classroom. Breaking down language barriers and breaking down barriers of isolation is an important part of what we do.    <br/>

                    OET- Occupational English Test
                </h3>
                 Overseas health professionals need to get good pass marks in OET tests in listening,

                 speaking, reading and writing to be able to gain registration to work in the health sector in the UK.  
                 Currently the OET is accepted by the GMC, NMC and GPC for doctors, nurses and pharmacists respectively.
                 
                 Working with the Sandwell HOP project we currently provide OET preparation classes for
                
                 overseas health professionals wishing to continue practicing in the UK.
                 
                 We are registered Premium Preparation Provider and all of our teachers are trained and
                 
                 experienced professionals. In addition our ever-growing team of volunteers provide
                 
                 students with the opportunity to practise speaking one on one with native speakers.
                 
                 We schedule regular mock tests throughout the year to help students become familiar with
                 
                 the test experience.

                 Many people coming to the UK from overseas need to prove their level of English for either
                 
                 professional or academic purposes and need to receive good marks in listening, speaking, reading and writing.
                 
                 Our teachers have a wealth of experience delivering IELTS preparation and we have a team of volunteers who offer their time so students can practise speaking with native speakers.
                 
                 Our IELTS course is funded by the Sandwell Language Network.
                 
                 We schedule regular mock tests so that students can get real test experience.

                 All of our courses are run online using Zoom. Students receive 5 hours of lessons a week delivered in two lessons. Students also have access to resources and practice material through our Google classrooms.

                 Due to the level of these tests students must demonstrate a minimum of Level 1 English (B2), we will consider a high Entry Level 3 (B1)
                 
                 For our IELTS course students must be Sandwell residents.
